# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is a machine learning project using the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict passenger survival. Just a fun beginner project to practice data cleaning, EDA, and model building.

# Summary

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using data from Kaggle.

## Files

- `data/`: Contains the training and testing datasets
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training
- `outputs/`: Predictions and any saved models

## How to Run

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
3. Open `notebooks/titanic_eda.ipynb`

## Goal

Predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using classification models.
